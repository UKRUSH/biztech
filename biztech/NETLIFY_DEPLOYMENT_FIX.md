# 🚀 Netlify Deployment Fix Guide

## ✅ Problem Solved!

The "Page not found" error you experienced is now fixed. Here's what was implemented:

## 📁 Files Added

### 1. `public/_redirects`
```
/*    /index.html   200
```
This tells Netlify to serve `index.html` for all routes, enabling client-side routing.

### 2. `netlify.toml`
Complete Netlify configuration with:
- ✅ Build settings
- ✅ Redirect rules  
- ✅ Security headers
- ✅ Asset caching
- ✅ Node.js version specification

### 3. `public/404.html`
Custom 404 page that automatically redirects to homepage.

## 🔧 Deployment Steps

### Method 1: Drag & Drop (Recommended)
1. **Build your project**: `npm run build`
2. **Go to Netlify**: https://app.netlify.com/
3. **Drag the `dist` folder** to Netlify dashboard
4. **Your site is live!** ✅

### Method 2: Git Integration
1. **Push to GitHub** with new files
2. **Connect GitHub repo** to Netlify
3. **Netlify auto-deploys** on every push

### Method 3: Netlify CLI
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```
