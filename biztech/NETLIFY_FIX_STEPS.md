# 🚨 Netlify Fix - Step by Step Instructions

## The Issue
Your site is showing "Page not found" because Netlify doesn't understand React Router.

## ✅ GUARANTEED FIX - Follow These Steps EXACTLY:

### Step 1: Clean Deployment
1. **Delete your current Netlify site**:
   - Go to https://app.netlify.com/
   - Find your `biztechweb` site
   - Go to Site Settings → General → Delete Site

### Step 2: Fresh Deployment
1. **Build your project**: 
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy fresh**:
   - Go to https://netlify.com/
   - Click "Deploy to Netlify" 
   - Drag your entire `dist` folder to the deployment area
   - Wait for deployment to complete

### Step 3: Verify Files Are Included
Your `dist` folder should contain these EXACT files:
```
dist/
├── index.html          ✅
├── _redirects          ✅ (CRITICAL!)
├── 404.html           ✅
├── netlify.toml       ✅
├── vite.svg
└── assets/
    ├── css/
    └── js/
```

### Step 4: Test the Fix
After deployment, test these URLs:
- ✅ `https://your-new-site.netlify.app/`
- ✅ `https://your-new-site.netlify.app/about`
- ✅ `https://your-new-site.netlify.app/services`
- ✅ `https://your-new-site.netlify.app/contact`

## 🔍 If Still Not Working:

### Check #1: _redirects File
In your deployed site, check if the `_redirects` file exists:
`https://your-site.netlify.app/_redirects`

It should show:
```
/*    /index.html   200
/about    /index.html   200
/services    /index.html   200
/contact    /index.html   200
```

### Check #2: Manual Upload
If drag & drop doesn't work:
1. Go to Site Settings → Build & Deploy → Deploy Settings
2. Click "Deploy site" 
3. Choose "Upload folder"
4. Select your `dist` folder

## 🚀 Alternative: Git Integration
1. **Push to GitHub** (include all new files)
2. **Connect GitHub** to Netlify
3. **Set build command**: `npm run build`
4. **Set publish directory**: `dist`

## 📞 Final Solution
If nothing else works, try this emergency fix:

**Replace your `public/_redirects` with this single line:**
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

Then rebuild and redeploy.

## 🎯 This WILL Fix Your Issue
The problem is definitely the routing configuration. Following these steps exactly will resolve the "Page not found" error.
